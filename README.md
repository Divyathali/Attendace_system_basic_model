# Attendance_system

 1. install opencv and tkinter in anaconda 
 2. Run attendance.py 
 3. just make a folder named TrainingImageLabel.



# Note
  1. Create the dataset using the same camera -  you can used in your projects. 
  2. In this projects we used the less number of data, we don't train it - diffrent quality of images & Deep learning methods.
  3. We delete the register method in Excel exports - if you want it, please include it--> in your code with proper path.

TrainingImageLable and .ipynb_checkpoints folder are need to be added.
